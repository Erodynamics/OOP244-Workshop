# OOP244-Workshop

If you found this Github when digging for how to do the workshops for OOP244, good job! This is the very messy code that I've made for the workshops at Seneca.
You can use this code to see how I've done the workshops, but DO NOT COPY IT AND CLAIM IT AS YOUR WORK. Don't be that guy.

Small note: Originally, the professors wanted us to use the cstring library that we made in Workshop 2 throughout the semester instead of the standard cstring library. During the semester that these workshops were written in, the professors have made an exception and told us to use the standard one instead.
