# OOP244-Workshop

If you found this Github when digging for how to do the workshops for OOP244, good job! This is the very messy code that I've made for the workshops at Seneca.
You can use this code to see how I've done the workshops, but DO NOT COPY IT AND CLAIM IT AS YOUR WORK. Don't be that guy.
